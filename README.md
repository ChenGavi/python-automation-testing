# Python Workshop
This course is a great introduction to both fundamental programming concepts and the Python programming language. 
By the end, you'll be familiar with Python syntax and you'll be able to put into practice what you'll have learned in a final project you'll develop locally.

## Installing Python 3

To install Homebrew, open Terminal or your favorite OSX terminal emulator and run

`$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`

Now, we can install Python 3:

`$ brew install python3`
