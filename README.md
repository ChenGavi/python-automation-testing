## Installing Python 3

To install Homebrew, open Terminal or your favorite OSX terminal emulator and run

`$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`

Now, we can install Python 3:

`$ brew install python3`
